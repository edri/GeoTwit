# What is GeoTwit?
GeoTwit is an application, which allows you to visualize real-time activities on Twitter's subjects with a map.

More information coming soon!

# Installation
In order to use the application, please follow the instructions below:

1. First install [Play Framework with Activator](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/Installing) on your computer.
2. Type `npm install` in your console in order to install dependencies.
3. Type `activator run` and open the “http://localhost:9000/” URL.  
This process will take a while the first time you access this page, since it has to download the
libraries and compile the application.
