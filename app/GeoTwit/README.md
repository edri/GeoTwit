# Installation
In order to use the application, please first install the Play framework with activator on your computer (https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/Installing ). Once done, just type `activator run` and open the “http://localhost:9000” URL.  
The process will take a while the first time you access this page, since it has to download the
libraries and compile the application.
